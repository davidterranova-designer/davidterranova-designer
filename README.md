# Hi, I'm David

Creative technologist, systems thinker, and multidisciplinary artist.

I've spent the last 15 years working professionally as a filmmaker, photographer, and designer. Before that, I began my career in tech: building immersive Flash websites and games for films, brands, and platforms like Pixar, PlayStation, and 20th Century Fox. I designed and built full-stack systems from scratch in PHP/MySQL, including internal CMSs and production management tools used by teams of 60+ people.

I’ve always been drawn to **systems thinking**, and how interface design connects with **memory, cognition, and perception**. Even while working in the creative world, I’ve maintained deep fluency across media systems — building infrastructure to manage massive libraries of music, photo, video, and code. My early Flash work gave me a foundational mindset: rethink the interface, start from scratch, design for the human.

In recent years, my frustrations with modern UX — from Finder to iOS — led me to develop new interaction concepts. I began building a topic-based interface layer that sits *above* the OS, reducing friction and surfacing tools only when contextually needed. This eventually became **ProjectPilot**, a personal productivity OS for high-entropy minds.

And then, my mum got diagnosed with dementia.  She’d went from being a computer-whizz to not being able to use her TV remote control.

What started as speculative design became essential. I built her a custom device that replaces her TV — turning it into a single-button interface for entertainment, therapy, and communication. It now handles video calls, memory prompts, media playback, and time-based reminders — all without requiring her to hold a phone or navigate menus. The underlying architecture evolved into **MemoryAssistant**, with other tools like **LifeLines**, **LetterScanner**, and **CalendarBuddy** branching out from the same core principles: **remove friction, increase clarity, align with the brain**.

I'm currently building functional demos of these systems using Python, SQLite, OpenAI, and local LLMs. Development is slow, but real — and grounded in lived experience. I'm looking to connect with devs, collaborators, and systems thinkers who share this mindset and can help bring these tools to life.
